\title{Sequential break point copula model.}
\usage{
BPfit(x, y, fam1, fam2 = NULL, parallel = FALSE, date_names = NULL,
  ncores = 2)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Numeric A vector of uniform marginal values.}

\item{y}{Numeric A vector of uniform marginal values.}

\item{fam1}{Integer An integer representing the family of the copula to use.
If \code{fam2} is not \code{NULL}, this value indicates the copula family
of the first copula component.}

\item{fam2}{Integer A second (optional) integer indicating the use of a 
mixture copula and the family of the second copula component. Defaults to
\code{NULL}.}

\item{parallel}{Logical Switch to run the breakpoint search in parallel.}

\item{date_names}{Character Vector of (optional) date/timestamp names for the
marginal distributions.}

\item{ncores}{Integer Specify the number cores to use in the parallelization.
If the user specifies more cores (real or logical) than the CPU can
support, the max number of supported cores will be used.}
}
\value{
\code{BPfit} returns an object of \code{\link[base]{class}}
  "seqBreakPoint".
  
  The summary, plot, coef, and logLik functions will, repectively, print a 
  summarization of the output, a plot of dependence measures, extract model
  parameters, and extract the log-likelihood values.
  
  An object of class "seqBreakPoint" is a list of lists, one for each regime.
  Each individual list contains the following components:
  
  \describe{
    \item{pars}{a vector of coefficients for the copula}
    \item{log.likelihood}{log-likelihood value for the regime}
    \item{dep.measures}{a list containing the tail dependence measures and
      Kendall's tau}
    \item{emp_hess}{the emprical hessian}
    \item{opg}{the outer product of the gradient}
    \item{sandwich}{the sandwich estimator}
    \item{family}{integers recorded from the inital call specifying which
      copula family to use}
    \item{points}{start and ending index values that subset the marginal
      series for the regime}
  }
  
  In addition, the following three attributes are included:
  
  \describe{
    \item{marinal_names}{names of the marginal series}
    \item{initial_bp}{information on the initial break points before a
      re-partition method is applied}
    \item{class}{class of the model}
 }
}
\description{
\code{BPfit} performs a recursive search over a bivariate time series of
  uniform marginal distributions.
}
\details{
The sequential break point model can be more computationally
  expensive than \code{\link{MSfit}} and \code{\link{STfit}}, especially
  as the length of the time series grows. This is due to the sequential hunt
  for break points.
  
  In the model's favor, robust standard errors can be calculated for each
  respective regime. In addition to the standard errors obtained by inverting
  the hessian, outer product of gradients (OPG) and sandwich estimates are
  also available. Standard errors based on the sandwich estimator are used
  in the summary.
