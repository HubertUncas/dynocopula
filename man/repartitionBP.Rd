\title{For the sequential breakpoint model, given a set of breakpoints, run a 
repartition of the breakpoints for improved consistency}
\usage{
repartitionBP(bpResultList, u, v, f1, f2, parallel = F, date_names)
}
\arguments{
\item{bpResultList}{The output form \code{\link{autoBPtest}}}

\item{u}{A vector of uniform marginal values.}

\item{v}{A vector of uniform marginal values.}

\item{f1}{An integer representing the family of the component copula applied
to u. This is passed to \code{\link{cop_static}}}

\item{f2}{An integer representing the family of the component copula applied
to v. This is passed to \code{\link{cop_static}}}

\item{parallel}{Logical switch to run the breakpoint search in parallel.}

\item{date_names}{Optional vector of date names}
}
